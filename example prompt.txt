I have a list of artists. Get their studio albums, and what year they were released in. Get the artists year of birth, if it cannot be found, then return a 0. Format the output as JSON with the following typescript format:
type ArtistInfo = {
  artistName: string;
  albums: { name: string; releaseYear: number }[];
  artistYearOfBirth: number[];
}[];The artist list is:
